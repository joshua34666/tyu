Not just an Universal MediaCreationTool wrapper script with ingenious support for business editions,  
![Preview](https://i.imgur.com/swCwiDi.png)  
A powerful yet simple windows 1X deployment automation tool as well!  

> awesome gui dialogs to pick windows version and preset action  
> **Auto Setup** choice for upgrade directly without prompts, with edition change / intelligent fallback  
> **Create ISO** choice for authoring iso file directly via DIR2ISO snippet, including any 'oem' customizations  
> **Create USB** choice for authoring usb via native MCT, including any 'oem' customizations (prompts once)  
> **Select in MCT** choice for vanilla MCT processing without 'oem' modifications, script quits straightway  
> control via set script vars, commandline parameters or rename script like `iso 21H2 Pro MediaCreationTool.bat`  
> set recommended windows setup options that give the least amount of issues when doing upgrades  
> pickup `$OEM$` folder with post setup tweaks like `$OEM$\$$\Setup\Scripts\` `setupcomplete.cmd` or `OOBE.cmd`  
> write `sources\PID.txt` file to preselect edition at media boot or windows setup  
> write `auto.cmd` file to run auto setup without prompts from media, on demand  
> 11: Skip TPM Check on media boot via winpeshl.ini file (cleaner than altering system hive directly)  
> 11: Skip TPM Check on dynamic update - system-wide (works for insider previews), also as standalone toggle script
