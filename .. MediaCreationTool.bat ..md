>**Create ISO directly** now available if ISO var set / script renamed with `iso` / provided via commandline  
> *via built-in powershell snippet*  

>**Dialogs** to pick version, then to pick `Auto Setup`, `Create ISO` or `Select in MCT`  
> *now more readable by using inverted selection style, and streamlined in a single powershell instance*  

>**Enhanced script name / commandline args parsing** - _can just rename the script with:_  
> `auto MediaCreationTool.bat` _to auto upgrade 21H1 - unattended, usually straight to desktop_  
> `auto no_update 1909 MediaCreationTool.bat` _to auto upgrade 1909 with Dynamic Update (latest LCU) OFF_  
> `pro auto 20H2 MediaCreationTool.bat` _to auto upgrade 20H2 and force Professional edition_  
> `enterprise 21H1 iso MediaCreationTool.bat` _to create 21H1 Enterprise iso directly_  
> Forcing an edition will skip the selection dialog when booting from media, if it's an existing index.  
> ProfessionalWorkstation and ProfessionalEducation should also work, but only for upgrades.  
> Makes editing the script text hardly needed. Can even set a retail / mak product key via script name.  
> More examples at the top of the script  

>**Enhanced Auto Setup and Create ISO** presets with embedded and cross-edition fix  
> Now usable from PosReady7 / Embedded where default MCT fails / can't upgrade keeping files and apps.  
> Script waits in the background for MCT to finish the first phase of creating upgrade media.  
> Then will copy `auto.cmd`, `PID.txt` and `$OEM$` dir to the iso sources folder (disable with `no_oem`).  
> Once that's done, it will launch setupprep for the second phase via `auto.cmd`, and finally quit.  
> Can start again this unattended upgrade setup (under windows), from `auto.cmd` on the iso / usb.  
> Featuring DIR2ISO snippet to create bootable ISO directly via script (MCT lacks public option for it)  

>**Dynamic Update** (downloading and installing latest LCU) default enabled, starts only for upgrade action.  
> It won't be included on created media. Instead, it starts if launching `auto.cmd` from media under Windows  
> Unlike using setup directly, it does a seamless upgrade with no prompts and the MCT troubleshooting OPTIONS  
> Working as intended, there's no need to recreate the iso / usb every month - but only on new esd releases.  
> Previously, the script disabled and ignored Dynamic Update, as it was not reliable enough.  
> _(upgrade with dynamic update can still fail with some packages, hence the `no_update` option)_  

>*bugs can happen after substantial refactoring in such scripts, so please report any you can find*
